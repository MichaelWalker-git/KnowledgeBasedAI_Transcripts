Let us do an exercise together.

Once again, we have the four
quadrants shown here, and

at the top left are four
computation artifacts.

I'm sure you're familiar
with all four of them.

C-3PO is a fictitious
artifact from Star Wars.

Can we put these four artifacts in
the quadrants to which they best belong?
