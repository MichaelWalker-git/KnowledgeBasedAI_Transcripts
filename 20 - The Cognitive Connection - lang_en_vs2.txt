At the conclusion of this lesson, we'll have a short video after the wrap up

called the cognitive connection. Knowledge based AI is richly connected to

cognitive signs. And so many of the topics that we'll cover in

this class are connected to human reasoning and human learning, and

human memory. The cognitive connections are not separate from the course. One of

the goals of this course is to learn how to use the design of AI agents to

reflect on human cognition. The cognitive connections will serve this purpose.
