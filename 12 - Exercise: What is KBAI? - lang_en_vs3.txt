So one thing that many students in this
class are probably familiar with is

Sebastian Thrun's Robotics
class on autonomous vehicles.

David, where do you think an autonomous
vehicle would fall on the spectrum?

&gt;&gt; So it seems to me like an autonomous
vehicle definitely moves around in

the world so
it certainly acts in the world.

And driving is a very
human-like behavior so

I'd say that it acts like a human.

&gt;&gt; What do you think?

Do you agree with David?
