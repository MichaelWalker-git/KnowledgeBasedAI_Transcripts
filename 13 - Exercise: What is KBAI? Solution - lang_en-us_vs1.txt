David, do we really care whether or
not the autonomous vehicle thinks and

acts the way we do?

&gt;&gt; I guess, now that you mention it,

as long as the vehicle gets me to
my destination and doesn't run over

anything on the way, I really don't
care if it does think the way I do.

And if you look at the way I drive, I
really hope it doesn't act the way I do.

&gt;&gt; So the autonomous vehicle may really
belong to the acting rationally side

of the spectrum.

At the same time,

looking at the way humans drive
might help us design a robot.

And looking at the robot design might
help us reflect on human cognition.

This is one of the patterns
of knowledge-based AI.
