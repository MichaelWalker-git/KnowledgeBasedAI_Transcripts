So at the end of every lesson, I will briefly recap what we talked about during

that lesson and try to tie it into some future topics.

Today, we started off by talking about the central conundrums and

characteristics of AI. This may have connected with some of

your previous experience with other AI classes, like machine learning in AI for

robotics. We then talked about the four schools of AI, and

we talked about knowledge-based AI more specifically, what is it and where does

it fit in with the other schools? Then we talked about cognitive systems and

how cognitive systems are always concerned with human like intelligence. Lastly,

we talked about the overall structure of the course,

which is broken up into eight large categories, like learning, planning and

analogical reasoning. Next time we'll talk a little bit more

specifically about this class in particular. The goals, the outcomes and

the learning strategies, and what projects you'll complete.
