This brings us to the first quiz. After every lesson in this

course we'll have a short quiz, in which we'll ask you to write down what you

learned in this lesson in this blue box here. These quizzes have two goals.

The first goal is to help you synthesize and organize what you have learned.

The process of writing down what you learned may help you, in fact,

learn it more deeply. The second goal is to provide us with feedback. Perhaps we

could have been clearer or more precise about some of the concepts. Perhaps we

left some misconceptions. Note that these quizzes are completely optional.
