David, what did you write it down?

&gt;&gt; So I said that the four fundamental
things a Watson must be able to do to

play Jeopardy are first read the clue,
then search through it's knowledge base,

then actually decide on it's answer, and

then phrase it's answer in
the form of a question.

&gt;&gt; That's right.

And during this course, we'll
discuss each part of David's answer.
