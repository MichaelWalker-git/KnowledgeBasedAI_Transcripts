David, which one of these do
you think are AI problems?

&gt;&gt; Science has said that all
of these are AI problems.

All of these are things that we
humans do on a fairly regular basis.

that can address each of these problems.

For now,
let us just focus on the first one.

How to design an AI agent that
can answer Jeopardy questions.
